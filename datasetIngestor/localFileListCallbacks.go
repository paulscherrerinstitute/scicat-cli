/*
CreateLocalSymlinkCallbackForFileLister builds the symlinkCallback used by GetLocalFileList to
decide, for every symbolic link found under a sourceFolder, whether it should be kept in the
dataset or skipped.

skipSymlinks holds the current policy and is mutated as the user answers interactive prompts:
  - "ka"/"kA" always keep, "sa"/"sA" always skip, "da"/"dA" keep only links internal to the
    sourceFolder (the default behaviour).
  - any other value (e.g. the initial single-letter "k"/"s"/"d") triggers an interactive prompt
    on stdin for that particular link; the answer given there may update skipSymlinks to one of
    the "*a"/"*A" forms above to apply to subsequent links.

skippedLinks is incremented every time a link is skipped, so callers can report a summary count.
